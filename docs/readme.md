Paranormal is the open-source semantic multimedia content management system.


## Goals

That looks like a lot of buzz words, let's unpack what all of that means:

 - **Semantic:** Paranormal should follow the rules of the semantic web.
 - **Interoperable:** Paranormal should allow people to see your content where they already are, such as RSS and ActivityPub.
 - **Multimedia:** Paranormal shouldn't just be focused on blogs and text, instead it should allow for the publishing of all kinds of media.
 - **Content management system:** Paranormal should always remain a content management system, not anything else.
